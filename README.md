# data-structures: C++ Template Classes

This is a collection of data structures created in C++ using templates. 
The finished collection includes:

* Linked-List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Search Tree
* Heap
* Hash Table

Each class contains considerable documentation, explaining many algorithms, their purpose, and their efficiencies; the library's main function is to provide reference to students who want to thoroughly explore data structures commonly found in computer science courses.
