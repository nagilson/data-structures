# Usage
Original classes were made within a VS project, thus the use of "stdafx.h," while will have to be uncommented. Compiling with VS is not necessary, however, you can choose to test the structures in VS through cmake. 
Classes incusion should be relatively simple / rudimentary, and each main shows how to use each class.

I decided to include the implementation in .h as these are all templates. .tpp files are not supposed well across compilers. 

# What is this Project?
I'm taking a data structures course and I wanted to implement all of the structures myself to test my understanding. 
The classes are not necessarily finished at this point, and I would not recommend using them for product end code (the implementations are relatively simple), however, they are functional. This hopefully serves as a useful reference for students trying to figure out how each data structure can be implemented, and why they would want to implement or use such a structure in the first place. I couldn't really find a repository of well organized and efficient boilerplate code online with explainations of the use of each structure, but admittedly, I didn't search very hard. 

# Data-Structures-C-
WIP C++ classes that include implementation of the linked list, stack, queue, binary tree, heap, hash table, and more.
